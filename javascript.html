                    <h2>Personal Productivity App</h2>
                    <p>This is a current project I'm working on. This is a personal productivity app which keeps
                        track of my calendar, my daily tasks, budget, and emails. This was my first exposure to 
                        using Node.js. It isn't the prettiest looking app right now but it is functional. The green
                        buttons hold tasks that count down/change color based on how many days are left before I need
                        to complete them. I also use free APIS to get a news story and joke of the day on my dash. This  is a project
                        I don't think will ever truly be finished as I'm always coming up with new things to add to it.

                    <h2>Mancala Game</h2>
                    <p>This is one of my first ever Javascript projects. It was a great learning experience
                        and introduction to html and css. The top row represent the user's holes and moves
                        can be made by clicking on them. The computer then automatically responds with its move.
                        The files for playing this game can be found on my Github page.
                        Below is a picture of me, about to lose to my bot.
